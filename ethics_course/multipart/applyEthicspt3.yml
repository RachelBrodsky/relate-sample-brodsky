      #### Ethical codes can also help guide us more broadly. Different organizations you might be affiliated with might have different ethical codes that can further guide you in your work. Here is the code of ethics from the National Society of Professional Engineers:
        >   - Hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.
        >   - Perform services only in areas of their competence.
        >   - Issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner.
        >   - Act for each employer or client as faithful agents or trustees.
        >   - Avoid deceptive acts.
        >   - Conduct themselves honorably, responsibly, ethically, and lawfully so as to enhance the honor, reputation, and usefulness of the profession.
