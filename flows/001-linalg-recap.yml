        # Overview

        The key objective of this coruse is for you to learn about ethics and the role ethics plays (or should play) in developing Artificial Intelligence (AI). You will do this through:
        >    1. Learning about the study of ethics
        >    2. Understanding how ethics applies to AI
        >    3. Exploring how we design and implement AI systems in ethical ways

      # Let's review what we covered.
      #### We explored ethics and how it relates to the field of Artificial Intelligence. Moreover, we explored how autonomous and automated systems are being placed in positions previously only held by moral agents. We have examined also how AI systems can have unintended consequences and key questions to ask in order to respond to those as well as mitigate them in the future.
      #### Ethics is a very large and old field, though as technology plays a larger and more powerful role in our daily lives it is important that we, as engineers and scientists, do what we can to ensure the systems we implement uphold our code of ethics.
